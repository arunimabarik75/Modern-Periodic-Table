# Modern Periodic Table

This project is about creating a Modern Periodic Table registry using File Handling and Structures in the C programming language. The project stores the data in binary form in the file `Element Details.txt`. 

## Usage

Use the file `Project Data Storage.c` to add details of more elements, including the element name, symbol, atomic number, atomic mass, natural state and uses.

To find the details of a specific element, use the `Modern Periodic Table.c` file. This file allows you to search for an element by its name, symbol or atomic number.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Modern Periodic Table.c`: This file contains the main logic of the project and allows you to search for element details.
- `Element Details.txt`: This file stores the binary data of the element details.
- `Project Data Storage.c`: This file is used to store the details of each element, including the element name, symbol, atomic number, atomic mass, natural state and uses in binary format.
